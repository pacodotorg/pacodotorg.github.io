title: Embed a video, why not?

I'm devoting less than 1% of my thinking time to this page. Yet it's constant.

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJHZA8ckzwE?start=22&end=30" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

Will this publish automatically, *if at all?*

And then what?

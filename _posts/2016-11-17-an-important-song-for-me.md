No explanation, really. At the time — 1991, I think — I was stuck in a bus for two days. It moved forward, yes, but ever so slowly. All the time, all I had was my Sony Walkman and one single tape — "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" by Elton John. Also, I only had two batteries. I also had one book, "Fear and Loathing in the Campaign Trail" by Hunter Thompson. The batteries ran out, I read the book twice. What a miserable time. What a wonderful moment.

OK, so there was some explanation.

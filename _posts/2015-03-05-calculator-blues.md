Last night, as I was tippy-tapping on my ipad and retweeting weather updates and listening to voicemails and reviewing information about the next day I thought about how mundane the whole experience was. I was suddenly reminded of that time in 1973 or 1974 when my father showed me what was then an absurd purchase, a pocket calculator with bright green digital numbers, that could add, subtract, multiply and good grief, divide with the push of a couple of buttons. 

From TV and movies I hear that the first heroin high is the best and probably the only one you'll ever enjoy. Other than the first 10 hours of "Combat" on the 2600 and the joy of BASIC programming, I'm not sure technology will ever again excite me as much as that little box with glowing numbers.

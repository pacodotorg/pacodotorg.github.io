Somewhere along the way, a friend of mine posted this video on Facebook, and I stopped disliking the song Rhiannon, that for whatever long-forgotten reason I disliked.

I think it was because it was featured in the TV-Guide channel of whatever cable system I had in the late 80s that kept on playing it over and over again. Welcome to the time machine.

> **EDIT:** _The truth is that I would probably still hate this song if tested under the same circumstances, i.e. repetead ad nauseum whil playing spades into the wee hours of the night with my roomate, with no real possibility of escaping the duldrum that was that apartment and contacting the outside world. However, finally watching this live rendition reminded me just how much I liked Stevie Nicks, perforated nose and all, and what a great time it must have been to have witnessed Fleetwood Mac at this point._
